Excel estimators of multi-scopic cell transmission model (MS CTM) for the A2F and F2A cases

Here, the core estimators of MS CTM for the two experimental cases are provided with the simulation results of Edie's vehicle following model (VFM).
According to the derivation of MS CTM in the dissertation, MS CTM is an explicit method. Therefore, it is convenient and intuitive to build a simulator by Excel.
However, the file size of the VFM simulator based on Excel, which is not expected initially, is too large to upload to GitHub. Therefore, only the simulation results are provided.

Thank you for reading.

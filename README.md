Excel estimators of multi-scopic cell transmission model (MS CTM) for the A2F and F2A cases

Here, the core estimators of MS CTM for the two experimental cases are provided with the simulation results of Edie's vehicle following model (VFM). As discussed in Section 3.3 in the dissertation, MS CTM is an explicit method and the sequence of the calculation is given. Therefore, it is convenient and intuitive to build a simulator by Excel. However, the file size of the VFM simulator based on Excel is too large to upload to GitHub, which is not expected initially. Therefore, only the simulation results of VFM are provided.

Additionally, the calibration of MS CTM and VFM is completed by an optimization algorithm which is discussed in Section 4.1.2. The optimizer and the obtained parameters are also based on Excel as shown in Model_Calibration.xlsx.

Thank you for reading.
